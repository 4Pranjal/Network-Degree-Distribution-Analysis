<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This repository contains Python code for analyzing and visualizing the degree distribution of a network using the NetworkX library. The degree distribution is a fundamental property of networks that provides insights into how connected nodes are in the network.

### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/)
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Python (>= 3.6)
* Pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/4Pranjal/network-degree-distribution.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository
   ```sh
   cd network-degree-distribution
   ```
3. Install required libraries
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

1. Open the Python script `degree_distribution_analysis.py` in your preferred Python environment.
2. Uncomment one of the lines that read network data from different files:
   - Uncomment only **one** line that corresponds to your network data.
3. Run the script to analyze and visualize the degree distribution of the network.
4. The script will generate two plots:
   - A histogram representing the degree distribution as a Probability Distribution Function (PDF).
   - A log-log plot showing the Complementary Cumulative Degree Distribution (CCDF).
